Introducing more diversity into the developer  community can foster creativity and innovation.</p> <p>This led to the decision to implement the Carbon Design System. Renowned for its simplicity and consistency, Carbon is  an excellent choice for user interfaces that prioritize functionality over aesthetics, such as dashboards, admin panels, and Human-Machine Interfaces (HMI). In contrast,  Material Design may be overly focused on visual elements for such applications.</p> <p>The journey began with Jetpack Compose, and as the project expanded, adopting Compose Multiplatform became a natural  progression. This evolution has culminated in the project becoming open-source, allowing the wider community to benefit from and contribute to its development.</p>"},{"location":"#project-status","title":"Project status","text":"<p>This project is currently a work in progress, with new components and features being implemented as development  continues and new versions are released.
